# Focus model data file
#
# There can be up to 20 fit terms, with different polynomial degrees of
#  elevation "e" (in degrees), temperature "t" (in degrees fahrenheit)
#  and azimuth "a" (in degrees).
# The constant offset can be denoted with "1".
#
# Example:
# term	1	3.50    -- constant offset
# term  eet     0.00003 -- temperature*(elevation^2)
#

term	1	3.50
term	e	0.0
term	ee	0.0
term	t	0.0
term	et	0.0
term	eet	0.0
